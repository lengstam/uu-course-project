Class: functions also with some data.

__init__ can make things available directly when package is imported (e.g. from .mammals import Mammals(or * for all) makes "from mammals import Mammals possible, instead of from mammals.mammals import Mammals). Preferable to simply import the module though, and show which function is being called every time.

Profiling: cProfile or line_profiler. Also %time and %timeit. Scalene.
Should profile my code before optimizing it.
